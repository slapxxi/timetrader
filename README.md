# Time Trader

**Time Trader** is a time-management web application that allows to manage
time as if it would an investment.


## Features

I want to lay out the features to be implemented here.


## JavaScript Replacement


- [ ] Use Elm instead of JavaScript to learn the basics of FRP and functional
  programming.


## Third Party Solutions

- [x] Embed any video from YouTube. It's interesting how easy it's to embed a
  video.

- [ ] Use a CSS grid framework. Instead of writing your own CSS framework,
  it's reasonable to use the most popular of the existing solutions.
