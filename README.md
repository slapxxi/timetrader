## Notes

- In Python to code an infinite loop you have to code it as `while True`.
The more reasonable option would be having a `loop` statement for that purpose.

- The most annoying thing about Python at the moment is its inconsistency in
naming and APIs in the standard library.

- Another inconsistency in Python is that in class definitions
parenthesis are optional if there are no arguments but in function
definitions they are not.

- Some functions in the standard library are fine with modifying objects
in place while it would better to use methods for that or return a new modified object if the function is polymorphic.

- Even though Python sometimes can be rather ugly due to inconsistencies or lack of features, it's still a clear and flexible language that provides a fine level of granularity. Thus, the most beautiful characteristic of Python is its flexible and precise nature that allows a programmer to be the master of the tool and not the other way around.
